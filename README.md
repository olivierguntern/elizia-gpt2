ELIZA:
ELIZA is a computer program developed by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966.
It simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist by reformulating the patient's statements into questions.
Limitations :
ELIZA works by pattern recognition and word substitution.
It can only provide general answers based on key words.
Transformations are simpler in English, the language in which ELIZA works.
Weizenbaum's statement:
Weizenbaum points out that ELIZA doesn't really understand.
It generates responses from predefined templates enriched with keywords found in patients' responses.
ELIZA and conversational agents:
ELIZA simply maintains the conversation by engaging the interlocutor.
Conversational agents, unlike ELIZA, provide useful answers using their databases.
Impression on interlocutors:
ELIZA was so convincing that people became emotionally dependent on their relationship with it.
The tendency to make sense of computer statements is called the ELIZA effect.

ELIZA demonstrates that it is possible to fool some humans with simple logical schemes.
The relevance of the Turing test for determining a computer's intelligence is still debated.
